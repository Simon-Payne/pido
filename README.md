A simple TODO web service with a minimal footprint for running on a small host such as a Raspberry Pi

I have been thinking about how I could practise my web services skills and also do something that would run on my Raspberry Pi.
So it would need a very small footprint (I'm thinking of a Pi 1 Model B with 512MB of RAM) with a heap size something like 32MB.
